    <div class="body">
      <p>
        I thought about you today,<br/>
        Reminded by two boys playing football;<br/>
        They played until the sunlight faded away,<br/>
        Much like we did every fall.
      </p>
      <p>
        So few are the days that come to an end,<br/>
        When I'm not reminded of our childhood days:<br/>
        As much time together as we did spend,<br/>
        A reminder lurks in every gaze.
      </p>
      <p>
        As boys, we roamed the piney woods, so vast,<br/>
        And raced our bikes down a country lane;<br/>
        Like the rivers we floated, youth rushed by fast,<br/>
        And a bond almost like brothers was our gain.
      </p>
      <p>
        And when into adulthood did we advance,<br/>
        Contact was lost&mdash;different lives on different trails:<br/>
        We reunited a decade later, by chance,<br/>
        And spent an afternoon reliving old tales.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thereafter, when a memory appeared,<br/>
        We sent messages and laughed at the thought;<br/>
        It's funny how we each remembered,<br/>
        Details that the other forgot.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I saw you rise from desolation,<br/>
        And you unselfishly helped others too:<br/>
        Chains broken, you sang of God's salvation,<br/>
        Using the very gifts He bestowed upon you.
      </p>
      <p>
        But our conversations stopped again,<br/>
        Failed connections, access denied;<br/>
        And a sense of foreboding stirred within,<br/>
        Until one day I received a call&mdash;you died.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, the song of our friendship plays differently,<br/>
        An instrumental rendition, vocals removed:<br/>
        And with time to ponder our friendship deeply,<br/>
        I find it more of a treasure proved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gone a year now, I miss my friend,<br/>
        Yet it comforts me to think heaven was your gain:<br/>
        And I hope the remembrances never end,<br/>
        They bring a smile to my face and a twinge of pain.
