        The summer before my senior year I worked as a rodman on a survey crew. As long as I live, I suspect it will remain the hardest job of my life, physically. When Todd and I hung out together that summer, I would complain about the days I spent in the steamy woods of South Mississippi swatting deer flies, wading through swamps, and listening intently for the buzz of agitated rattlesnakes. It didn't help that he liked to talk about the relatively easy job he had working at his cousin's convenience store. Naturally, when Todd tipped me off about an opening at the store the week before school began, I seized the opportunity.

        The store stood at the crossroads of two state highways in Runnelstown, a rural community about a half hour drive east of home, literally on the edge of nowhere. It was the only store of its kind for miles around, and we sold a little bit of everything: soft drinks, smoked ribs and chicken, motor oil, fish bait, and cans of Vienna sausages to name a few. But we didn't sell beer because of an elementary school and church nearby.

        Not long after I started, Todd successfully petitioned his cousin, a mysterious fellow who I only saw once in about a year working there, to allow us to run the store together on Friday nights. Todd ran the cash register and gas pumps while I performed odd jobs around the store, such as stocking, cleaning, loading sacks of dog feed, and cutting up whole chickens. After my summer experience, the job was a breeze and Friday nights quickly became the highlight of our weeks.

        Most of the clientele were local folks who managed to project a warm sense of contentment despite the hours of hard labor they put in each day. Some were more interesting than others; when they entered the store even the bell on the door seemed to ring an octave higher. There was Herbert, an older gentleman who owned a catfish shack around the bend near the river. Most nights, after he closed the restaurant, he would roll up in his Mercury sedan, purchase an RC Cola and a moon pie, and feed his sweet tooth while he enlightened us about random topics at our prompting. After his snack, Herbert always smoked one cigarette from a pack that he kept behind the cashier's counter, due to his wife's disapproval. Smashing the butt of his smoke in the ash tray by the door, he would bid us farewell by hollering out, "You boys be good, and I'll be Herbert!" As he strolled out the door like John Wayne and drove away, we couldn't help but chuckle at Herbert. But he took a special interest in us and we only had good things to say about him.

        Another older man lived across the highway in a modest shotgun house. They called him Papa Squirrel and I have little reason to doubt this wasn't his legal name. His visits were rare. But when he did shuffle in wearing his black boots and a cowboy hat, which seemed disproportionately large for his wiry frame, we gave him the royal treatment. Unlike Herbert, Papa Squirrel's words were few; for the most part he only grinned as we showered him praise. You see, he was somewhat of a legend in Runnelstown. Each night around dusk he would sit on his screened-in front porch and blare out old Hank Snow tunes on his stereo. After a few minutes into it, he would begin to sing along with Hank on a PA system. Even with the door shut, his performances came through loud and clear. His act went on for a couple of hours and, although it amused us, we admired Papa Squirrel, if not for the quality of his voice for the gusto he exhibited.

        There were other characters in our Runnelstown saga, like the trusty deputy sheriff who would stop by and check on us. One night he tracked down a thief who ran off without paying for his gas. We decided letting the law deal it was better than our initial idea of running after him with the pistol kept behind the counter. There was also the annoying man who stopped by every couple of weeks selling fake gold watches. We knew they were imitations, but we humored him by trying them on and acting impressed. They were all key characters in our story whose very presence added to our other pastimes at the store, like bowling with discarded cans in the back room, making anonymous peacock calls from the back of the store, or terrifying friends with sudden movements from the dark recesses of the walk-in cooler as they reached in for a beverage. In the half hour before closing, customers were few and far between. We would fill the lull in activity by throwing a football between the long isles of groceries. We received the football free in the mail by saving the UPC codes off cases of Castrol motor oil. It was a cheap rubber ball with the Buffalo Bills logo printed on it at our request, even though neither of us could be fans of a team from that far north. As you can see from the picture, I still have the ball.

        Walking to our cars after closing, we would wave at the local kids as they whooped and hollered in our direction from the empty lot on the other side of the highway where they loitered. Todd would drop off the cash from the register at his cousin's house and we would rendezvous later at either his house or mine to play Sega into the wee hours of the night. Looking back, it's hard to believe his cousin put us in charge of his store, but we appreciated it. Many memories were made there and we learned a lot from the unassuming and unique people of Runnelstown.
