        Cruising the back roads in my '85 Ford Ranger with the windows rolled down, Todd and I had one thing on our minds; salvaging what remained of our spring break. Since the day we dismissed from school, it had been raining, eroding our plans faster the barren hill down by the creek. At times, the storms swelled into a weather phenomenon we referred to as gully washers, which turned our yards into shallow ponds. With nothing left to do inside, we moped around despising the deluge as the sound of raindrops thumping on the roof filled our rooms. By the middle of the week, the ground was a muddy sponge, streams were swollen, and a maddening case of cabin fever had infected us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, on Friday, just as we were on the verge of doing something drastic, like homework, the rain ceased, proving the local weatherman wrong, yet again. Although everything outside was a waterlogged mess and the sun remained hidden behind lingering clouds, a euphoric sense of freedom revived us. It was a flicker of hope, a chance to venture out and release our pent-up energy before the resumption of classes, and we intended to seize it. A few options were briefly considered before we settled on the most adventurous activity available to us; floating the Okatoma.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Technically speaking, the Okatoma was classified as a creek, but, given the broad span between its banks, it had the appearance of a small river, and few people regarded it in any other way. It was a relaxing float, just a short drive away, and it had achieved an appreciable degree of popularity with the locals. Indeed, we were no strangers to it ourselves, but never had we floated it together. So, with no further deliberation, we set out for a canoe rental store on the Okatoma via the scenic route, with Todd riding shotgun and me behind the wheel. All our frustrations were in the rear view mirror, but adventure can be a tricky thing, as we would soon be reminded.
      </p>
      <p>
        We arrived at the store's gravel parking lot to find it empty, and we thought it might be closed. As we exited my truck to investigate, a young fellow with a scruffy beard stepped onto the front porch, yawning and stretching like a bear rising from his winter nap. The logo on his shirt told us he worked there, a guide no doubt, and, thus, we knew they were open. Eyeing our approach from the porch, he slowly slipped a wad of Skoal in his lip. As we waited for him, we wondered, under our breath, if there was a story behind the odd totem pole standing tall near the steps leading up to the porch. A toothy grin suddenly spread over the guide's face as he extended the warmest of county greetings. He said he was working solo that day and it was good that we stopped by. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We requested the rental of one canoe for the duration of the afternoon. Without so much as a liability waiver, he took our money and gathered our gear. To make ourselves useful, we helped him load a battered aluminum canoe onto a trailer that was hitched to a worn white van. We hopped inside as he turned the key on the ignition, and, after a brief hesitation, the engine roared to life. We settled in for the short ride upstream to the launch point concealed under a small bridge near Seminary, Mississippi. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Our guide was a chipper fellow, about four years our senior, and for the duration of our drive he talked nonstop. The conversation, mostly one-sided, focused on a guy from our school that he knew well. "So, you boys are from Petal, huh? Do you know a dude named Red? He's from around there and I used to hang out with him all the time." Indeed, we knew this Red he spoke of; the very mention of his name caused us to shutter. Last year, he was a senior, while we were lowly freshmen, and, as far as we could tell, his sole purpose in life was to torment boys from our class. We had managed to avoid any altercations with him, but we heard stories of others who weren't so fortunate.
      </p>
      <p>
        It didn't seem like a good time to risk rocking the boat with our new friend--for all we knew he may have shared Red's tendencies--so we told him what he probably wanted to hear. "Yeah, we know him. He's something else," we replied. This response, though noncommittal, fanned the flame of our host's memories as he expanded on their adventures. Even after we arrived at the launch, the stories continued and gradually captured our attention to the point that we were distracted from our upcoming rendezvous with the Okatoma.
      </p>
      <p>
        He unloaded the canoe and, as he handed over our life jackets and paddles, informed us that we would have exclusive access to the stream that day. "Not too many people go out when we're running at flood stage," he added. It was our first indication of trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second was the sight of swirling vortexes spawned by the fierce flow funneling through the gap under the bridge. The current was stronger than I had ever seen it, and as we sat down in the canoe, me up front and Todd in the back, it was obvious we hadn't thought this trip through. But before I could voice my concern, I felt the canoe lunge forward, persuaded by a swift kick from the bearded one's muddy boot. With a crazed chuckle, he hollered out, "Hang on, boys! And try to stay out of the bushes!" 
      </p>
      <p>
        The Okatoma immediately snatched our vessel, propelling us downstream like a runaway locomotive. I glanced over my shoulder at Todd and knew by the anxious expression on his face that he too was contemplating the plight to which we had so eagerly subjected ourselves. Yet there was no time to lament our decision as we careened into a stretch of turbulent whitewater. With scant control over the canoe, we bobbed through the water, adding a few more dents to the hull along the way, before breaking free from the first of many rapids we were destined to face that afternoon. At that moment, it was clear that survival hinged upon our ability to keep both the canoe upright and our posteriors in it. Todd succinctly summed it up when he shouted, "If we flip, we're goners!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Normally, flipping on the Okatoma was no cause for concern; if one did enter the stream all one had to do was stand up in the knee-deep stream. In fact, most flips were intentional, a fun break from the South Mississippi heat. But the Okatoma's choleric disposition that day made our goal seem nearly impossible. It easily qualified as the most dangerous situation we had faced thus far in our young lives, and, as I eyed another wave of whitewater up ahead, I realized that never had I floated this stream without flipping. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, we were still young enough to consider ourselves somewhat invincible. Sure, we had heard the stories about tragedies involving kids like us, but they always happened to people we didn't know in some other town. This naive optimism worked in our favor, blocking inklings of fear as adrenaline surged in our veins. We shouted over the sounds of the water to coordinate our actions and worked the paddles like extensions of our arms to dampen the canoe's acceleration and keep us in the least threatening routes. All the while, we did our best to maintain a generous buffer with the semi-submerged brush along the flooded banks, following the sole instruction offered by our guide. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It was true, there were no other people on the Okatoma that day, but we were not entirely along. In addition to the logs, trash, and other debris floating beside us, we spotted a couple of water moccasins along the bank, which bolstered our resolve to stay in the canoe. Our clothes were drenched and we each lost our ball caps at some point. But we gripped our paddles firmly, well aware of their value, and locked horns with an overachieving creek that seemed determined to devour us, like ole Red with the freshmen. We learned, out of necessity, how to efficiently steer by submerging the paddle head and pushing against the current. And by synchronizing our efforts, we managed to achieve some control over our craft. There wasn't much need for paddling, our speed was more than adequate. Braking and steering, we progressed downstream, unaware what was ahead or how far we had traveled.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we encountered deeper places, where the surface was less brutal, we let the canoe drift and our arms rest. But these brief respites were sparse; far more prevalent were the rapids, where our canoe bumped, reeled, and scraped against boulders that threatened to spill us. When we weren't shouting instructions to one another, we openly deliberating who was to blame for this predicament. For the sake of unity, we pinned it on the guide.
      </p>
      <p>
        We rushed past the 1-hour pickup point, a small sandbar hidden around a bend, before we realized it, and, thus, missed our only chance to escape. It was just as well; our guide wasn't there to pick us up anyway. The sandbar faded out of sight behind us, and we found ourselves committed to the full 3-hour float. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There were many tense moments, but the most terrifying point was at the falls, where the river dropped about 6 feet near the halfway point of the float. Even on a normal day, it was a sticky spot to slip through without taking a spill. Before we remembered it or had time to plan our approach, we were upon it. Only God knows how the canoe managed to center the large rocks on either side of the narrow falls, but we made a perfect descent, spilling over into the widest lagoon on the Okatoma. The nose of the canoe dipped down into the stream at the base of the falls, adding a few inches of water in the bottom of our canoe and, in the process, nearly catapulting Todd from his spot in the back. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The lagoon past the falls was deep and served as a swimming hole. On any other day we would have stopped there to take a refreshing swim and mingle with other adventure seekers. I pointed out the old rope swing hanging from a massive oak up on the bluff and remembered, from prior trips, the thrill of swinging out over the water, releasing just as the rope was on the verge of moving back toward the bank, and dropping into the water. Clearly, there would be no swimming or swinging that day, all we could do was imagine the cannonballs and belly busters that might have been as we left the lagoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        The balance of our trip was more of the same, an unrelenting struggle against the Okatoma's punishment for the visit we had paid it. It seemed the river had some issues to work through that day, the week of rain had affected it as much as us, and, naturally, it wanted to do so alone. Although it wasn't easy, we kept the canoe upright and avoided all the disasters that seemed inevitable when we began our journey. And for each set of rapids we conquered, our confidence grew. Indeed, during the latter stage of the float, we reached a tipping point after which we were genuinely enjoying ourselves. We cut up, splashing each other and deliberately rocking the canoe, while laughter echoed in the valley.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of the float, the river opened up before an old truss bridge with a large sign to the right marking the sandbar of the rental store. Although the stream was wide and deep there, the current was still strong and it required every last ounce of our energy to reach the shore, but we made it. When the front of the canoe reached the bank, I jumped out and pulled the canoe clear of the troubled waters. The sensation of planting my feet on solid ground was sublime. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We sat down by the creek for a few minutes to rest and bask in our accomplishment. Surveying the swift stream, we laughed and patted one another on the back. It was a bittersweet moment; sweet because we were exhausted and happy to be alive, but bitter because it was exciting and fun, after we got things under control. It reminded me of riding a roller coaster; both terrifying and exhilarating in the midst of it, and after it ends you want to get back in line for another round. Even so, this ride had no seat belts or safety features, unless you counted the worn out life jackets, and we wondered how we had survived. Then, we vowed to never float the Okatoma, or any other river for that matter, at flood stage again.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the front porch where he was sleeping in a rocking chair, the guide eventually spotted us and wandered over, scratching his beard. He picked up where he left off with the stories. While we were helping him carry the canoe, he said, "You boys finished the 3-hour float in an hour! That's got to be a record. I probably shouldn't have let y'all go out, since the store was closed and all, but y'all looked like you knew what to do." 
      </p>
      <p>
        It was shocking information, but we simply went along with it, like it was no big deal, either to appear macho or because we were too tired, I'm not sure. We bid our new friend farewell, grabbed a couple of Gatorades from a vending machine, and loaded up in my truck to head back home. By then, the sun was shining bright, and its warmth felt great combined with the wind as we dried out. On the trip back, we relived the most harrowing moments, as we would continue to do for many years. It's ironic, really, that a spring break, which seemed destined to be forgotten, turned into an experience that, of all the antics we got ourselves into, best embodies how we grew up in the country. Suffice to say, conquering the Okatoma at flood stage was a memory that never faded.
