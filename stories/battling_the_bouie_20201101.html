        It was a hot and humid Saturday afternoon in late July, and we had no business going down to the Bouie River in the first place. How Todd and I wound up there was a bit arbitrary, now that I think about it. When we rendezvoused earlier that afternoon even our destination was unclear, only to be settled later on a whim. You might say our attitude that day was laissez-faire, which is probably how we ended up in such a royal mess. We never intended it to happen the way it did; it was not like we had a death wish or anything crazy like that. Granted, as teenagers&mdash;rising sophomores to be precise&mdash;we could be quite melancholy sometimes, grumbling about everything under the sun, but life was generally enjoyable and the future bright. Since it happened over three decades ago, it's possible the passage of time has diluted my recollection of that day, and now I attribute entirely too much credit to us for the way everything panned out. Perhaps, by some strange twist of fate, we were simply destined to wander down there and face the fragility of life. It's all a mystery to me. All I really know for certain is I would have long since forgotten that day had we not gone there; but because we did, I will always remember it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first domino toppled, so to speak, when Todd called my house sometime after lunch to ask a favor. "Hey buddy! What's up with your bad self?" he said, dropping one of his cocky greetings like he did from time to time. We both had our quirks, but he owned this one. By starting a conversation with some shocking statement, he believed it gave him an initial upper hand. I saw it backfire on him a few times, nearly resulting in us getting our tails kicked, but most of the time it was effective, odd as it may seem. Other than being slightly annoyed, I mostly ignored it since he did it so often.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Not much. I was staring at my summer reading for English, seriously thinking about cracking it open," I said, tossing the paperback back on my desk. "I take it the funeral is over?"
      </p>

      <p>
        The funeral was for his grandpa who had died on the previous Thursday for reasons I never knew. I only knew they held the visitation Friday night, and the funeral was planned for that morning. I saw Todd briefly at the visitation, the first such event I had attended of my own accord. For support, I brought along a mutual friend whom I was hanging out with that night. Todd was surprised to see us, maybe even a bit embarrassed, probably because we were underdressed. Naturally, we didn't stay long.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yeah, the service was this morning," Todd said in a downcast tone. "We got back around lunch. It's been a rough day, chief. Heck, it's been a rough week. As we speak, about half of my family is in my kitchen along with folks from church who keep dropping by. I need to get out of here for a while and clear my head, man. What say you come pick me up and let's go hang out somewhere?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Todd was a couple of months shy of receiving his license to drive, but I started driving in January. I had an old '85 Ford Ranger with nearly 100,000 miles on the odometer. It used oil, occasionally backfired, and guzzled gas, but I was glad to have it. And since my friends who were always asking me to drive them places, they apparently were too. Even so, my first thought about going anywhere usually revolved around my fuel gauge and wallet. I could be a real tight wad back then, agonizing over things like wasting my precious fuel carting friends all over town. But I was feeling more generous than ever that summer, thanks to a little money in my pocket from a job with a brick layer. My dad had arranged it, like most of my summer jobs in high school. The work was grueling, but I appreciated having a real job and a nice paycheck. On the job site, they called me the 'mortar forker', which says a lot about the work environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        "I need to check with my mom, but it should be fine. Unless I call you back, I'll pick you up in a few minutes," I said, happy for yet another excuse to delay my summer reading project. I truly despised being cooped up inside, especially after a hard week at work. And the way I saw it, the longer I postponed reading that book, the fresher it would be on my mind when school began.
      </p>
      <p>
        Todd and I were practically next door neighbors with only two houses standing between us. At most, it took me about five minutes to reach his driveway. When I arrived, I could see he was not kidding about the volume of visitors. Honestly, I had never seen so many vehicles at his house. Cars were parked along the edge of the driveway, on the shoulder of the road, and even in the front yard. And as I eased up the narrow driveway, I was already dreading the inevitable task of backing out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Todd was perched on the short brick wall by the carport. When he saw my truck, he hopped down and hustled over. It was a relief to see he was already outside because I was spared from going in to retrieve him. I realize that sounds awfully unsympathetic, but I really was not that big of a jerk; I sincerely regretted that his Grandpa had passed away. The problem was I had no clue how to address someone in mourning. I could be a real worry wort sometimes, overthinking simple things. Ever since I left my driveway, I had been racking my brain about what I should say. But I had some kind of mental paralysis because the only words I could muster seemed insufficient and canned. In similar situations, I had heard people say, "I'm terribly sorry for your loss," and, had I gone inside, that is probably what I would have said. Personally, I would have preferred to be left alone, but I knew some people didn't operate that way. Take Todd, for example, who had called me for the sole purpose of unloading his thoughts, something I would have avoided altogether, and yet we were almost like brothers. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, as Todd settled into the passenger seat I asked, "So, where are we headed?" Since it was his idea to get together, I assumed he had a plan. 
      </p>
      <p>
        "I don't know. What I'd really like to do is go hang out somewhere and talk. I have a lot of things on my mind. I wish we could go to a ball game or something," he said. Many an afternoon we had spent watching college baseball games at Southern Miss, but the season had ended almost a month before. That was a shame because it was hard to beat an afternoon spitting sunflower seeds at the ballpark, hoping to catch a foul ball. What really got us jazzed up was joining the crowd as they heckled the opposing team, especially when a coach made a trip to the mound. One season, the local newspaper printed a photograph of us in the grandstand, hollering like we actually had some skin in the game. It made no difference that the caption failed to mention our names, we still felt like celebrities.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Sure," I absently replied. I was only halfway listening to him as I struggled to back out of the cramped driveway. It was a delicate operation, exacerbated by my truck's manual transmission. I alternated between riding the worn clutch, opening the throttle, and angling my foot to stomp the brake, if needed. The only thing that would be worse than me stumbling through condolences to his family would have been barging in to apologize for swiping someone's car.
      </p>
      <p>
        It took a few minutes, but I cleared the driveway and pointed my truck toward town. And then Todd blurted out an idea, "How about we go down to the Bouie River? You know, down there by the 42 bypass bridge. I've been wanting to check it out ever since you and Michael went fishing there a while back. Remember?" 
      </p>
      <p>
        I detected the slightest hint of resentment in his tone, or maybe I just imagined it. Ever since I told him about that impromptu fishing trip after baseball practice, he had seemed sore about it. Todd and I were always getting our feelings hurt, a state of mind we referred to as being 'ill', when one of us did something with someone else. It was downright ironic because we had been best friends since elementary school. But the truth is we had this bad habit of ditching each other from time to time, which always spawned a vicious cycle of retribution that never seemed to end. It was incredibly silly, but you take a little thing like hanging out with a mutual friend or venturing out with an odd number of kids and someone always ended up ill. I was convinced all teenage friendships were inclined to such illogical illness; it happened all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Alright, alright, but we can't stay long. My dad was pretty ticked off about me going down there before," I said, remembering the stern warning he gave after my earlier fishing trip. After spotting my truck parked at the river on his way home from work, he warned me, in no uncertain terms, that I was to never go back without his permission. It was similar to the ultimatum he delivered before a recent camping trip with my friends when he said, "Chad, just remember your butt is the grass and I'm the lawnmower." 
      </p>
      <p>
        Because my dad was at drill duty with the National Guard, I assumed we were safe. If he did find out, I would explain the situation with Todd's grandpa and pray for lenience. And if that failed, I would blame Todd, which was a perfectly acceptable practice. Several years before, Todd and I had agreed that when we got into trouble, we could blame one another. I am not sure it ever helped, but we felt clever about it all the same. Honestly though, we rarely went off without telling our parents know where we were headed; but when we did there was always some type of crisis. It's unfortunate we never really figured that out until we were much older.
      </p>
      <p>
        "That's fine. I need to be back home in a couple of hours for diner anyway," Todd said. And in keeping with our willy-nilly attitude that afternoon, our destination was settled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Todd started fiddling around with the dial on my stereo, manually scanning the radio stations, while I drove to the bridge over the Leaf River on the Highway 42 Bypass. It was four-lane bridge, one of the widest in the county, directly downstream from the point where the Bouie spilled into the Leaf. From the north side of the bridge, the junction of the two rivers was clearly visible. Our destination was a large gravel parking area overlooking the Bouie on the other side of the bridge. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The 42 bridge spanned the boundary between two cities; we lived on the Petal side and Hattiesburg was on the other side, along with the Bouie. Hattiesburg dwarfed Petal in size, and most of the jobs and stores were located there. So, it was quite common for Petal residents to cross it on a daily basis. When I was a kid, I always sat tall as we drove across to sneak a peek at the junction of the two rivers. Even as I grew older, I couldn't resist the urge to look down. What fascinated me the most was a patch of land on the far side of the junction where a dense stand of trees filled the interior and lush, green foliage hung over the river's edge. In a region of South Mississippi known for thick clusters of pine trees, it was one of the most alien landscapes I knew. If you saw a photograph of it, you would swear it was a jungle scene from the Amazon. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The junction jungle was in a flood zone and, as far as I could tell, uninhabited. When the rivers swelled, a frequent event back then, the boundary between land and river ceased to exist as water flowed through exposing the gnarly roots of the trees. Maybe there was a way to reach that spot without crossing the river, but if such a route existed it was well concealed. Shrouded in dark shadows cast down from the numerous trees, this untouched jungle, almost hidden amongst the hustle of suburban life, completely captivated me. When I saw it, I imagined was what it would be like to walk around in there. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If anyone had actually embarked on such an expedition, it was probably one of the local anglers who frequented both sides of the bridge. People used the boat ramp under the Petal side of the bridge to launch boats and spend weekends fishing down the Leaf, which was the wider of the two rivers. Each year, there would be at least one report of an angler or two drowning on the Leaf. Search and rescue crews would rush out to comb the river for survivors. More often than not, the search would turn into a mission to recover bodies, and brave divers would sink down into the muddy waters to investigate, sometimes encountering catfish the size of Volkswagens near the bottom, or so we heard. But from the bridge, high above it all, the water appeared to flow peacefully, and it baffled me to think that a grown man could drown there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over on the Hattiesburg side of the bridge there was no boat ramp, just the gravel parking area and a sandy bluff with trails leading down to the Bouie. On a typical day, points along the bank would be occupied by anglers, usually from the nearby East Hattiesburg neighborhood. It was a rough neighborhood, the kind where folks lacked the money required to buy fancy bass boats or high dollar fishing gear, but we had never heard of any trouble at the river especially in broad daylight. And since no one was there when we parked, we had no second thoughts about carrying on with our harebrained idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        We meandered down the bluff like a couple of Labrador retrievers, navigating a labyrinth of trails in search of a spot along the stream. When the trail opened on a suitable point on the bank, we saw the junction of the two rivers on our right. It all looked different from this vantage point; nothing like the aerial perspective from the bridge that towered over us from behind like some kind of concrete monster. With a steady stream of vehicles crossing the bridge, the thumping of tires as they slapped the expansion joints reverberated beneath the structure creating an ambience reminiscent of the drum line in an old Led Zeppelin song.
      </p>
      <p>
        Judging from the pile of discarded worm boxes nearby, we had stumbled upon someone's fishing spot. I told Todd we should have brought some fishing gear, and he reminded me that he had never been freshwater fishing and, had we brought gear, I would have had to teach him how to fish for bass. I went freshwater fishing with my dad on local rivers and lakes, and Todd went saltwater fishing on the coast with his dad and brothers. And even though we'd been friends for a long time, we'd never gone fishing together. I no more knew how to saltwater fish than he did freshwater; yet another peculiarity of our tangled friendship.
      </p>
      <p>
        An old piece of driftwood lay unnaturally a few feet from the water, probably dragged there by the one who left all the worm boxes. It seemed like the perfect place to take a load off, but not before we checked around it for snakes. Ever since we were kids, adults never missed an opportunity to lecture us on the dangers of snakes, especially under logs and near gopher holes. It was very practical advice for kids growing up in South Mississippi where scores of poisonous snake species slithered around. Naturally, Todd and I were always on the lookout for snakes in the woods, but we rarely saw any. Around a body of water, it was different; it was a safe bet that a cottonmouth was coiled up somewhere nearby, so perfectly camouflaged they were only noticed when they moved. Just because we didn't find any, we knew from experience that didn't necessarily mean we were completely alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Long day, huh?" I said, offering an opening for him to speak his mind as I completed my scan the undergrowth surrounding us. I had only been around his grandpa a few times, but he was always friendly and usually joked around with us about random topics. I sensed he and Todd were close, but I was not sure since we rarely chatted about our extended families. Both of my grandfathers had died before I was born, so I had no idea what he was going through.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yeah, I miss him already. He was always so cool to me. Momma's been crying on and off since Thursday, but I think she feels better now that it's all over. She's pretty tired though. She won't let on that she is, but I know. Man, you should see all the food at my house! Everyone who stops by brings a casserole or something. But all I really want is a Ward's chili dog," he said with a slight snicker. It was the first time I had seen a grin from him in two days.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I could always go for a chili dog and root beer," I replied, my mouth already watering. Ward's was a local fast food chain famous for hot dogs, burgers, and a few other items all smothered with their own unique brand of chili. To wash it all down they sold delicious root beer served in an oversized frosted mug, if you dined in. It wasn't uncommon to see Mr. Broom, who owned the Petal Ward's, manning the drive-thru window. He played baseball at Petal High well before our time, and when he handed over the order, he usually said something like, "Enjoy your food, Coach!"
      </p>
      <p>
        When Todd began to speak, it was like someone had opened up a water spigot. He told some stories that I'd never heard before and others I already knew, like the time his grandpa cured a strange habit Todd had when he a youngster. For no apparent reason, Todd would stick an arm out and rub his cheek against his shoulder over and over. 
      </p>
      <p>
        "One day Grandpa told me I needed stop it before my folks put me in a special class," Todd said. "It scared the crap out of me, so I quit. Problem solved." He proceeded to repeat the move a couple of times, complete with the facial contortions that had accompanied it, and we couldn't help breaking out in a fit of laughter. He kept talking, and for the most part I just listened. The more he talked, the better he seemed to feel.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this therapy session, we passively gazed at a seemingly infinite volume of brown water mixed with rich Mississippi soil as it flowed by on a long, arduous journey to the Gulf of Mexico. The Bouie was running neither low nor high that afternoon, typical for that time of the summer as we transitioned into the dry, sweltering heat of August. Up close and personal, the current seemed more turbulent and faster than the serene vista from the bridge. Logs drifted by, bobbing and spinning from the boiling turbulence. Every so often debris would pop up on the surface, twist around, and then disappear underwater a moment later. While Todd cleared the cobwebs from his head, the river was busy flushing tons of debris from the surrounding area. It was a tremendous display of natural power, and I'm not sure how we overlooked it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Todd eventually stopped talking about his grandpa, having either exhausted his collection of stories or reached some level of closure. At that point, there was little left for us to talk about, and with the sun steadily losing the sky we knew our time was short. We stood on the bank and started slinging sticks into the river. When we ran out of sticks, we hauled down a few handfuls of rocks from the bluff for skipping. With a nice flat rock, we were capable of achieving 10 or more hops on a pond, but given the egg-shape of the rocks and the rough surface of the river we were doing good to manage 4 or 5. We threw them anyway, and in tracking the projectiles as they bouncing across the river our attention was gradually guided to opposite bank, about 50 feet ahead, where the junction jungle was on display in all its mystique.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I've always wondered what it would be like to walk around in those woods. I'm not sure how you'd get there, except by swimming across," I said as I side-armed the last of our rocks. It took one hop and plunged into the river with a splash, and that's when we should have gone home. But I had unknowingly planted a seed with my statement, and we were in one of those moods.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You know, I'd like to see what's over there too. We should swim on over, it's not that far," Todd said.
      </p>
      <p>
        "What about our clothes? We can't go home soaking wet."
      </p>
      <p>
        "No problem. We can leave our clothes here and swim over in our underwear. When we get back, we'll slip them on and go home. We will be over and back before you know it. Come on, it'll be fun," Todd said.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Man, I don't know," I said, apprehensive because we had never swam in a river like the Bouie. A little voice in my head was telling me it wasn't a good idea, but I dismissed it. "What the heck. Let's do it." 
      </p>
      <p>
        Todd and I were extremely competitive, and, if he thought he could do it, nothing would keep me for joining in, lest I seem weak. We had also read stories like those by Mark Twain where swimming in a river seemed as natural for country boys as riding a dirt bike. In a crazy way, we decided we had been missing out on a basic rite of passage for every boy. We were too young, inexperienced, and stubborn to acknowledge any danger.
      </p>
      <p>
        We quickly shed our clothes, tossing them on the log. Knowing someone on the bridge might see us if we delayed, we quickly plunged into the turbid water and swam side-by-side on the surface toward a point on the opposite bank. It only took a few minutes for us to reach our destination. Crouching in the muddy bottom along the edge, we were barely winded and feeling rather smug. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Ideally, we would have had more time to ponder the first leg of our trip. Had that been the case, there is a high probability that we would have realized it was too easy; like some unseen force had transported us across. And perhaps that realization would have altered our route back. In fact, I am sure of it. Unfortunately, we were robbed of that luxury because when we turned around to glance back, we saw the silhouettes of two men with fishing poles at the top of the bluff. They were far away, and it was unclear where they were headed, but from our vantage point it sure seemed like they were about to descend the bluff in the general vicinity of the path we took earlier. 
      </p>
      <p>
        "Oh crap! Do you see those two guys walking down the bluff?" I whispered, like they might hear us or something.  
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yeah, I see them! Do you think they'll steal our clothes?" Todd asked. Of all the dreadful scenarios we could have imagined, it baffles me that we locked on something so childish. Still, the mental picture of us driving home in wet underwear was mortifying; I started to blush just thinking about it. And the worst part would be explaining it all to our folks. Judging from Todd's wide eyes and pale face, he was thinking the same thing. 
      </p>
      <p>
        "Let's go!" he said, shoving off the bottom to assume the lead in our hasty return. I followed suit, abandoning our jungle expedition without so much as a peek inside. It was just as well really; we couldn't very well go walking around the woods in our underwear anyway. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We swam with the utmost urgency, benefiting from the infusion of ample amounts of adrenaline in our veins. And our initial progress was good, that is until we crossed over into the deep water where we hit a wall. It was like we were calves in one of those amateur rodeos that came through town a few times a year; running fast out of the shoot until a lasso caught us, tightened around our bodies, and anchored us in place. It was only then that we realized the current had been behind us on the trip over; we were facing it pretty much head-on as we tried to return. Finally, after missing the river's warning signs all afternoon, we developed an intimate appreciation for the power of the river, a savage force worsened by the convergence with the Leaf. We swam harder and managed to continue our forward progress, albeit at an exceedingly slow rate. And with every inch we gained, the strength of the current seemed to only increase, due to the bend in the Bouie there. I am fairly certain we could not have picked a less favorable route.
      </p>
      <p>
        Todd was swimming freestyle about 10 feet ahead of me. Even without the head start he would have taken the lead because he was a better swimmer than me. That's because he could float, while my body had a natural tendency to sink like a brick. I tried ducking below the surface to swim, usually a better approach for me, but with the undertow I immediately realized it was mistake and rose back to the surface. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We couldn't talk to one another; it was hard enough trying to breath without swallowing a mouthful of dirty water. And that same sense of competition that propelled us into this mess emerged again, overshadowing any inklings of panic as we each hoped to reach the bank first. Minutes later, we found ourselves crossing the midpoint and losing steam. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It was not the first tight spot we had faced. When I accidentally stabbed the artery in my wrist, it was terrifying, but I was much younger and after my mom and sister swooped in to help me, I knew I'd be fine. Todd had accidentally set his kitchen on fire several years before while trying to fry bacon, but his mom sprang into action to extinguish the blaze prior to the fire truck's arrival. And when Todd and I floated the Okatoma at flood stage the previous spring, the stream was ominous, yet we knew keeping the canoe upright was all we had to do to survive. But our battle with the Bouie was unprecedented, and as a level of exhaustion settled in, more intense than anything I had ever experienced, I knew we were in trouble. I completely forgot about racing Todd and even the men coming down the bluff as fear suddenly overcame me. Todd was locked in his own struggle up ahead, but when I stole a quick glance it seemed like his efforts were more deliberate and effective than my own. He was making some progress, while I was on the verge of losing ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        I honestly decided we would not make it, and a number of thoughts crossed my mind. I thought about the sadness it would cause my family, especially the disappointment my dad would feel knowing I had ignored his warning. Todd's family had just buried one their own, and we were on the verge of handing them a whole new tragedy. I imagined friends of our families shaking their heads and saying, "I'm so terribly sorry for your loss." And, selfishly, I thought about all my dreams that would be lost like the rocks we had committed to the river. It was this empathetical reflection on the ripples our foolish decision might cause that made me swim harder. And then I got mad; intensely frustrated because the bank wasn't all that far away. My arms and legs burned, and I was struggling to keep my head up. And even though my body screamed for rest, I knew pausing for even a second would be a fatal mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
        Up ahead, I caught a glimpse of Todd scampering onto the bank. He looked back at me with a little concern in his eyes. I yelled, "I don't think I can make it." I thought maybe he could get some help.
      </p>
      <p>
        Todd started shaking his head to indicate that wasn't acceptable. He began shouting at me, saying things like "Don't you give up on me!" and "Come on! You can do it!" 
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought to myself, "He made it out, surely I could too." And his words inspired me to muster what energy I had left for one last push toward the bank. I cycled my arms and kicked my legs like a lunatic, desperate to get escape. Then, I caught the backside of an eddy, which swept me toward the edge. And I could feel the release of the jealous river's hold on me as my knee sunk into the mushy river bottom. I crawled the last few feet in the shallows, until I reached the edge where I grabbed Todd's outstretched hand and he pulled me out on the bank where I collapsed in a heap.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I caught my breath, elated to be on dry ground, I was relieved to see our clothes there, dry and undisturbed. As we quickly dressed, I said, "Definitely not as easy you promised." And we shared a shaky chuckle.

        The men who prompted our return were nowhere to be seen; perhaps they ventured further upstream. I wondered if they ever saw us out there, fighting for our lives. We had no idea how long it took to swim back, but the sun was much lower, and we knew we had to leave. We jogged back to my truck, and on the drive home we celebrated our triumph; we had conquered the Bouie and lived to tell about it. The truth is, however, we never actually told anyone for fear that our parents might find out.

        When our dip in the Bouie cropped up in future conversations, we would laugh at our folly and slap one another on the back at our accomplishment. Only after we became adults did we openly acknowledge how close we came to death. But you can rest assured that from that day forward I never wondered how a man could drown in the river.

        It's hard to pinpoint any single action that helped us walk away from that episode. Maybe it was the shame of going out that way. Maybe it was our competitiveness, although it was the also force that persuaded us to take the plunge in the first place. Maybe it was the help from a friend. I honestly think it was all of those things, working in unison through God's mercy, that pulled us out of the abyss. Otherwise, I am certain we would not have survived. It wasn't like us to sit around and ponder our mortality together; it was soft and not something we were accustomed to. But I fell asleep that night contemplating the fragility of life and I suspect Todd did the same. If we were going to survive being teenagers, we needed to be more careful. Not that we actually did that or anything.
