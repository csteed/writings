        Down the hill behind my childhood home, a creek with no name meanders through the valley as I imagine it has for untold ages before. When I was a boy it hosted a steady supply of cool water, fed by underground springs and runoff from the storms that regularly swept over the rural region of South Mississippi I called home. In the shallow places, where the current was swift, the water was as clear as glass, magnifying algae-covered rocks on the bottom. In the deep places, where the flow was slugggish and sediment concentrations increased, the surface was so opaque that when I leaned over it I encountered the reflection of my face tinted Mississippi mud brown.
      </p>
      <p>
        The creek, for the most part, was a terribly insignificant feature of the countryside. Those whose property it cut across were aware of its existence, yet neither they nor their ancestors had bothered to assign it a name, an odd departure from the treatment of other natural elements in the area. As far as I know, only two lives were appreciably influenced by its presence; they were country boys who lived nearby. Although the rest of the world had seemingly overlooked this small creek, it and the valley that hosted it defined the childhood of those boys.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where the creek and the land they roamed intersected, the boys knew all its twists and turns. Once, they located its origin at the edge of swampland about a mile to the north. From there, they followed its meandering route through acres of uninhabited woods as it traced the lowest contour under a thick canopy of mature pine trees with a few oaks mixed in. Though sparsely located, these gnarled hardwoods, with their massive trunks and thick, sprawling limbs, were like giants holding court over the more numerous pines that, by comparison, were mere toothpicks. The rhythmic swaying of the submissive pines made even the slightest breeze detectable, while the proud oaks would sooner topple than bend under a gale. Except for rotting logs and fallen branches, the ground was carpeted in crackling leaves and thick layers of pine straw. Undergrowth was sparse, consisting of hardy bushes that eked out an existence in the speckled sunlight. Amply shaded, the woods remained at least ten degrees cooler than nearby fields, even in August when temperatures regularly surpassed the century mark and humidity levels were never far behind.
      </p>
      <p>
        The small creek eventually emerged from the darkness of the woods into an open field situated between the homesteads of the two boys. There it was subjected to the full power of the sun as it flowed behind a sprawling garden that reaped pink-eyed, purple-hull peas in June and watermelons in July. Atop the hill above the field, an old red barn held a commanding view of the sweeping valley below. Besides the garden spot, the field was covered in grass with dozens of fire ant beds scattered about, and it stretched into a narrow strip of land owned by the family of one of the boys. At the property line, the creek passed under the remains of a rusty barbed wire fence and changed course to parallel the boundary for a stretch. It bent again and proceeded along a diagonal trajectory until the next turn where it completely vanished into the darkness of a dense thicket of briers and vines at the edge of another neighbor's land. The creek's route beyond that point was a mystery. Presumably, it continued twisting through the next patch of woods, where the thick undergrowth dispelled any fleeting inclinations that were entertained by the youth to venture within.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the annual hurricane season, tropical storms swept up from the Gulf of Mexico bearing drenching downpours that rapidly overwhelmed the creek, flooding the valley. Viewing the transformed landscape from the hill above, it seemed that a sizable lake could exist there, if some industrious soul dammed the creek ahead of the thicket. Such grand visions vanished like a vapor when the slightest drought arrived, robbing the creek bed of all traces of moisture and leaving exposed patches of mud to bake and crack under the scorching summer sunlight. It was the soil's composition, a unique mixture of sand and clay, that rendered the valley unsuitable for sustaining any significant reservoir of water. Nevertheless, the ground was perfect for absorbing floods, filtering the water down into underground rivers and salt domes and restoring the normal state of the valley. This unquenchable thirst added a sense of urgency to the creek's task of funneling water further downstream, lest it disappear below.
      </p>
      <p>
        Droughts were common in late summer, but the rain always faithfully returned, be it in days or weeks. The showers revived the stream, resuscitating plants, trees, and wildlife nearby. Patiently, this creek with no name tolerated the demands of its host environment, along the with boys' meddling, forever committed to channeling fresh water in a southerly direction, spilling into larger creeks that, in turn, poured into mighty rivers on a prolonged pilgrimage to the warm, brackish shallows of the Gulf. Although peripheral in the grand scheme of things, no other single feature was as vital to this valley, supplying vivacity over decades of variability.

        I returned to my childhood home not long ago and retraced the path down the hill leading to the creek, wondering what emotions a reunion with it might stir up. Topping the hill, I noticed it was more prominent now, thanks to my dad who, since his retirement, had dedicated much of his free time to clearing the field of all the brush that once concealed the majority of the creek bed. This portion of the valley was now clean and picturesque, like a memorial garden to a bygone era that bore scant resemblance to present times. Walking alongside the creek, I noted the current was nearly as strong as I remembered it decades ago. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Naturally, the sight of it caused me to think about those two country boys and the story of their childhood, so deeply rooted in the place where I stood. I knew their story well, for one of the boys was me. The other was Todd, my childhood friend, who lived a couple of houses up the road where the creek flowed out from the patch of woods to the north. Ours was a simple story, fueled by another resource this land gave to those with enough time and imagination to siphon it off&mdash;unbridled adventure. 
      </p>
      <p>
        From the day we met in elementary school to our high school graduation, we invested countless hours together exploring the countryside that was, at the time, sparsely populated. For miles, we were the only boys, and the adults who lived around us, all distracted by work and making ends meet in a limping economy, paid little attention to our gallivanting. The entirety of the valley beyond our homes was a treasure to us, but the creek was more precious than gold. We were fortunate to discover it early in our lives and found satisfaction in keeping it our secret.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our domain was generous; it included our family land and the open field with the garden and barn between our homesteads. The field, with its central location, was our designated rendezvous point on Saturday mornings and any other time we could break free during the week. We also probed the darken woods to the north where the creek originated, although we rarely traveled as far as the swampland. We enjoyed free rein of the countryside, and the adults graciously overlooked our utter disregard for property boundaries, loosely identified by sagging fences with rotten posts. Besides occasionally crossing paths with the neighbor who tended the garden, we never encounter another soul out there. Especially in those early years, when we had all the time in the world and life was splendidly simple, nothing rivaled the excitement of a trip to the woods.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were obsessed with expanding our domain, migrating deeper into places yet unseen as we grew older and more courageous. During these forays, the creek served as a vital point of reference, our routes keeping us within hearing distance of the water as it babbled over smooth rocks and tree debris. The sound of flowing water created a peaceful atmosphere that harmonized with songs of birds and chattering of squirrels as they monitored our intrusions from the safety of the trees. It was easy to lose track of time and detach from the world when we entered this wooded environment, and sometimes we faced disciplinary consequences for returning late. But when we did make our way back home, the creek guided us like the lights of beacons leading a ship to port.
      </p>
      <p>
        At a few bends, modest sandbar bars had formed from the persistent grinding of rocks over the years. We often found ourselves at these places slipping off shoes, rolling up pants, and wading out into the chilly water that rose to our knees in spots. We learned the hard way to step carefully on the muddy bottom with our bare feet, lest we stab ourselves with sticks or pine cones. And as we moved about, we kept our eyes peeled for water moccasins, always assuming one was lying in wait.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the grassy field, the sunlight warmed the water, darkened our farmer tans, and fueled rampant growth of bushes and briers, all laden with sharp thorns. The thickets grew tall, well above our heads and far too dense to penetrate, forcing us to divert our trails around them. We would peer into these impenetrable fortresses, dark as night, and shiver as we imagined what concealed eyes might be tracking our movements from within. Sometimes we found blackberries intertwined in the tangled mass of vines and forgot our fears of the unknown long enough to sample a few juicy specimens on the spot.
      </p>
      <p>
        The creek tempted us to take risks and we rarely resisted. Where the banks grew narrow, we took running leaps from one side to the other, simply to prove we could or to follow through on a dare. Our legs grew longer, as did our confidence in our ability to clear increasingly wider segments, which inevitably led to overconfidence, hard landings, and temporarily bruised egos. Where logs had fallen across the creek, we took turns inching over the span between banks, eventually mustering the courage to walk across with outstretched arms for balance. In the deep spots, we threw rocks at the creek to see how many skips across the surface we could achieve. Flat rocks held between the thumb and index finger and thrown sidearm worked the best, and we became masters of the art. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In the trunks of a few trees along the bank, we carved our initials and those of a couple of girlfriends, for posterity, with dull pocketknives that we never quite learned to sharpen. A willow tree hanging over the creek on my family's property received the bulk of our carvings. With shallow roots in moist sandy soil, it eventually succumbed to a hurricane, and I helped my dad cut and pile its remains against the fence where, over several years, it gradually melted into the ground.
      </p>

        As I walked through the valley that afternoon, passing by many of these places, vivid memories returned to my mind, despite the decades that had passed since my childhood. I felt fortunate, even a bit undeserving, for the adventures Todd and I shared; each passing year added to their golden quality. In a curious way, it seemed like only yesterday we were camping out near the spot where I was standing. Memories of campfires and sleeping in a tent under a clear, star-studded sky made my arm itch as I recalled the miserable bouts with poison ivy and red bugs that usually ensued. While evidence of our camping had long since disappeared, some of our old paths were still detectable as faint indentions in the ground; I wondered if they would ever completely vanish. I rested on stump, near a place where we used to cross the creek, and listened to the wind whispering through the pine needles. For a moment, I could almost hear reverberations of our laughter, still echoing in the valley as the cool breeze brought the fresh aroma of pine sap to my nostrils.
      </p>
      <p>
        I found myself wishing I could go back in time and be a boy again, if only for a day. Todd and I would meet at the creek crossing and continue where we left off, scouring nooks and crannies hidden in the terrain. But I knew my wish was silly; time only flowed in one direction. I would have settled for a couple of hours walking around with Todd, reliving the good times as we followed the creek upstream as far as possible. Perhaps we could open up some of those thickets and finally unlock their mystery. But I also knew such a reunion was impossible now that Todd was gone; a reality I still find hard to fully accept.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes I chuckle to myself about our antics, other times I wonder how we made it through hazards unscathed. We were partners in crime, different in ways that seemed complementary, except when they were most definitely not. I think about Todd often, now that he is gone; when you spend as much time together as we did, it is hard not to find something to trigger a reminder every day. And when I do, I usually wonder aloud why he exited this world so soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few years after we left our homes to begin our separate lives, the flow of water in the creek ceased, leaving dust where grass didn't completely take over. My parents and the neighbors suspected someone, or more likely a family of beavers, had dammed up the creek near the swampland upstream&mdash;perhaps someone succeeded in creating a lake in the valley after all. Ironically, Todd and I also gradually lost touch and our lives diverged to the point where we didn't speak at all for over a decade. It was unthinkable really, after living out a childhood that left us almost like brothers. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, we reconnected, a few years before the accident that took his life. During those years, we communicated regularly across multiple state lines, harnessing text messaging and social media technology. We were both available anytime to remind one another of random events from our past as they cropped up. After setting our friendship aside for so long, memories once again flowed, at least for a few years. During that period of time on trips home, I also noticed  a steady increase to the creek's current, restoring the normal lively state of the valley. Maybe the lake upstream didn't work out as planned, doomed from the start by the sandy clay, and the dam finally broke. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As I sat on that stump in the midst of our old stomping grounds and recounted such memories that afternoon, I thanked God for the renewed life in the creek and our friendship, be it ever so brief. And I realized that even though we lost several years and opportunities to connect our families and form new memories, the bond we forged in the valley remained strong. When we reconnected, we were still on the same wavelength in many ways; given the opportunity to speak with him again, I'm confident we would not miss a beat. Over four decades of life have convinced me such friendships are quite rare.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we did communicate in those years before his death, our conversations usually took us back the adventures we drew from the creek. Several times, as we ended a session, I told him that he should write a book about us growing up. I always thought he was the superior writer, even before he pursued an English degree in college. And he would laugh off the suggestion, probably thinking I was joking, but I meant it. In the stories I write, I endeavor to do the thing that he shrugged off. They represent my perspective of a complex friendship, too extraordinary to be forgotten completely. Perhaps it would be easier if I dismissed the idea and let the stories disappear completely when I die someday. Although that would be a shame, it is not my primary motivation. You see, when I ponder our times together and translate my memories into words, I feel a connection with him. And since it's the only link with him that remains for me, I am compelled to hang on as long as I can.
