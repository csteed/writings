        The stretch of Highway 11 between Petal and Eastabuchie was the longest, most linear length of flat asphalt I ever laid eyes on as a boy, not that I was exactly a world traveler or anything. A perfectly straight shot that went on for several miles, it was a real anomaly as far as roads go in South Mississippi. And because it lacked the usual sharp curves and blind hills, the driver's mind was free wrestle with whatever gripped it, assuming the traffic conditions were right. For pedestrians, however, it was a terrible place to be under any set of circumstances. For one thing, the sight of such a seemingly endless expanse of highway apparently made the temptation to exceed the 55-mile-an-hour speed limit irresistible. People really flew down that road, which kept the highway patrol busy writing tickets. And although the treat of getting pulled over or, more rarely, a well-trained conscious occasionally limited some of the speeding, the most effective restraint was the fleet of heavy 18-wheelers coming and going from the gas storage facilities and construction plants located just outside Petal. When caught in a parade behind one these trucks, agitated drivers would impatiently peek over the dashed center line until the slightest opening to pass emerged. And if the lead driver hesitated, it was not uncommon for folks as far as three cars back to stomp the gas and zip around the traffic clot. Speeding cars and wide 18-wheelers were bad enough, but the worst feature, from a pedestrian's perspective anyway, was the shoulder, or lack thereof. Barely wide enough to accommodate the signage, the narrow mound of earth was covered in tall grass, probably because it was too risky for the highway department to mow. All things considered, only a fool traveling on foot (or bike) would have dared cast a shadow on that stretch of highway, a fact Todd and I learned the hard way on a hot August afternoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be fair, we were just a couple of kids, several years south of the legal age for driving a car. And while using the highway, or any road, for its intended purpose was not an option for us, we were quite adept at riding our bikes due to the copious chunks of time we invested in popping wheelies in our driveways and riding back and forth on the country road between our homes. In the early days, when we were mere fledglings of the road, we stayed close to the nest. One of our favorite destinations was a small patch of woods standing catty-corner to Todd's house, a place we called the Gullies because the terrain was filled with small, rolling hills, or gullies. Todd's next door neighbors owned it, and they enjoyed a commanding view from the other side of the road. According to Todd, many years before our time his parents had helped save their house from a fire or something very dramatic like that. I suppose a deed like that would bond neighbors anywhere, but in Leeville such things were remembered for generations. Nevertheless, we failed to work up the nerve to knock on their door and formally ask permission to explore the Gullies. And even though it was likely unnecessary, we found ourselves sneaking over there; I guess it was more interesting that way.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the front end of one summer vacation, when we were still enjoying the euphoria of being excused from our educational obligations, we realized the Gullies had tremendous potential as a site for building a bike track like those we had seen in BMX magazines. We wasted no time raiding our dads' shops for shovels, rakes, and machetes, and over the course of several days we cleared small pines and raked straw to form a narrow path through the heart of the space. To make it more challenging, we added a few ramps from packed dirt with embedded sticks, an idea Todd concocted for extra durability. The completed track consisted of two straight segments, which were connected by gradual turns on each end to form an elongated oval circuit. It was almost exactly what we had imagined. In fact, it was probably the most successful project of our childhood, and our grins stretched from one ear to the other from the pride we felt over completing it without any help.
      </p>
      <p>
        The track began near the entrance to the Gullies, which was also the highest point. The initial drop was steep, a descent of about ten feet almost straight down, providing more than enough momentum to complete the first half of the course. It was a downright nerve-racking experience, one that required a fair amount of energy to keep the bike headed straight with all the hills and modest air we caught. Failure to stay on course meant a crash into the clusters of small pines crowding the edge. And although we had a few of those, we managed to avoid any major injuries. Still, the thought of wearing helmets or padding never crossed our minds. Even if it had we would have been hard-pressed to find that kind of equipment or, for that matter, scrounge up the necessary cash. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The track's main hazard stemmed from its narrowness; it could only accommodate a single bike at a time. So, while one rode, the other kept time, which was completely consistent with our competitive natures. Riding bikes in the Gullies occupied us until we were ushered back to school. Autumn arrived soon enough, and with it came football season when all we could think about was tossing the pigskin in our front yards. Thus, bike riding was put on the back burner until we had more time.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        By the time the next summer came, the idea of riding around in circles in the Gullies had lost its luster. We were searching for a new activity, preferably one that involved riding our bikes. It was time, we decided, to expand our range deeper into the heart of Leeville where we would link up with a couple of friends about our same age. So, after airing up our tires and lubricating our chains with far too much WD-40, we pedaled down Leeville Road for a rendezvous. 
      </p>
      <p>
        On our first trip, one friend suggested we follow a worn dirt path, far more utilitarian than our track in the Gullies, through some woods to the railroad tracks, which paralleled the straight stretch of Highway 11. Our sole purpose for going there was to spot a train, and because a dozen or so rumbled through every day the probability of us seeing at least one was very high on any given afternoon. We could always hear the trains blowing their horns from our homes, and nearly every night I feel asleep to their howls echoing down the hollow. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We were particularly interested in spotting the somewhat elusive Amtrak passenger train, which came through daily either heading to or coming from New Orleans, but we never seemed to time it right. Instead, we usually had to settle for a freight train bound for God knows where and loaded with anything from automobiles to long tanks filled all sorts of chemicals and gasoline to closed box cars with mysterious contents. The freight liners were massive mechanisms manufactured to meet the market demands of the masses, and the line of rail cars they pulled appeared to go on for miles. Sometimes the procession would come to a long, drawn out stop, reverse direction, and drop off or pick up cars at switching tracks located near the gas wells. Reconfiguring the train cars was a slow, systematic process, causing mild traffic jams at the numerous crossings linking Highway 11 to Petal, Leeville, and Eastabuchie. A traveler heading west from any of those locations would almost certainly spend some time staring into oblivion as a train rolled by, yet another opportunity for the mind to wander. The longest of these was the coal train, which pulled a prolonged procession of open rail cars piled high with rough chunks of coal, black as night. Once I overheard my dad say the coal train consisted of a hundred cars&mdash;if stopped by it at a crossing it was best to cut the ignition and take a nap. All the freight trains were long and slow, towing such heavy payloads that they often had two or more engines at the front. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The path we followed through the woods ended at a tree line bordering the tracks. Standing on the boundary between the woods and the bed of rocks supporting the rails, we observed these power plants plowing past, shaking the ground beneath our sneakers as the air filled with plumes of hot exhaust that reeked of spent fuel. It was a terrific display of raw horsepower, even if the engines only ran at half throttle due to the proximity of the numerous railroad crossings. A few crossings in Petal were equipped with automatic crossbars that dropped when sensors detected a train approaching. But in the rural areas, the only warnings were stationary signs in the shape of an 'X'. Both varieties were scenes of tragic vehicle collisions, at least one or two every year; failed attempts to shave a few minutes off a trip to town. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Our vantage point was near the spot where the engineers started gradually increasing speed as they crossed into the less populated countryside. And the track was elevated, about eye level from where we stood at the tree line. As the engines proceeded further down the line, the rumblings of the powerful pistons were replaced by the high-pitched squealing of steel wheels on steel rails while the rhythmic clanks of the rail joints added percussion to the mechanical melody, at times as constant as a metronome. We would stand at the edge of the woods and gaze at the thick rails, so perfectly polished from the high pressure contact with thousands of wheels each day that they reflected the sky like two canals of calm water. As the wheels rolled over the rails, they bent like popsicle sticks and settled into a steady oscillation that reminded me of rising and falling waves in the ocean. The processions of rail cars came and went, and we stood there mesmerized. A few times, prior to a train's arrival, we tried placing a penny on the rail hoping to gain a flattened token to forever commemorate our experience. Of course, we never actually found the pennies when the trains passed, despite extensive searching; it seemed like they simply vanished, pulverized into a fine copper dust that deposited itself in the bed of rocks.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the last days of our summer vacation, when we had almost given up all hope of seeing the Amtrak, we perked up one afternoon upon hearing its unmistakable horn howling up the line toward Petal. As it sped through the busy crossings, the horn blew almost nonstop, ceasing only after the engine cleared the city. Standing between the rails, the engine's headlight grew from a distant speck to an intense beam of light, despite the intense radiance of the afternoon sun. It was closing in on our location fast, and in a couple of minutes the shape of the engine was discernible.
      </p>
      <p>
        We scrambled down the rocks to the grassy buffer between the tree line and the track bed, not quite sure what to expect. A few yards before the Amtrak reached our spot, the engineer really laid on the horn again for a few seconds, emitting a blast so deafening that it nearly knocked us all to the ground. Perhaps he was giving us a warning to stand clear. Or maybe he was responding to our arm motions as we all gave the universal signal for blowing the horn; the same pull-down motion we gave 18-wheelers from the back seat of the family car just before our dad's told us to knock it off. And between the horn blaring and engine roaring, my ears were ringing from my first real heavy metal concert. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The Amtrak pulled a light load, about a quarter of the length of a typical freight liner. Watching it race by at a peculiar angle made me a little dizzy. The view disoriented me and left me thinking that the train was leaning in our direction; for a moment I thought the whole thing might crush us. Obviously, it did not, but between the sounds and the turbulence of it rushing by, we all took a step or two backwards. In a matter of minutes, the Amtrak was gone. After the caboose passed, we climbed back up the tracks and watched it fade like a mirage into the waves of heat rising from the tracks. As we rode back home, we imagined what a bunch of turkeys we must have looked like to the passengers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The day we spotted the Amtrak marked the end of our journeys to the railroad; as a destination, it just never came up again. I guess seeing it was like reaching the peak of a mountain; returning there seemed about as lame as riding bikes in the Gullies. We also managed to spook ourselves thinking about stowaways in those empty freight cars. In due time, we found ourselves mulling over possibilities for our next adventure. It was always like that with us; every new adventure was a gateway to the next, which was usually a notch bolder, or more reckless, depending on your perspective. I am not sure if we had a problem contentment or we were simply adventurous; maybe it was a little of both.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Another school year passed slowly like one of those heavy freight trains, but when we were finally free the simple serenity of summer was a breath of fresh air. To occupy our time that summer, we set our sights on a country gas station at the Highway 11 intersection in Eastabuchie. We could have headed in the opposite direction, toward Petal, where a closer, more familiar gas station was located, but we never even considered it. It was Eastabuchie or nothing, which seemed a little odd because there was nothing terribly attractive about that rural area. Even the weatherman on the local TV station simply labeled it and all the outlying land around it PIB, which stood for Points-In-Between, on his maps. Actually, where Leeville ended and Eastabuchie began was always a bit unclear to me too; everything just ran together. If it was not for the white water tower with Eastabuchie painted on its side in bold black letters, an outsider passing through might never know it existed. Eastabuchie did, however, have the gas station, which was more than Leeville offered, and I suppose that and the remoteness of it all was the draw.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our first trip there was around the first of July, after the last out of baseball season had been recorded. A five-mile ride one way, it took some planning and the better part of an afternoon to complete the journey. We only managed a half dozen or so trips there before school reconvened. Like the previous summer, we rode along the edge of Leeville Road, which took us all the way the intersection where the store sat on the opposite side of the highway. It was not an easy ride, especially in the heat of summer, but our youth gave us all the stamina required. There were a couple of steep hills on our route, one of which we called Dead Man's Hill because we figured if a man was in the road there when a car topped the hill, he would be a goner. Otherwise, it was a relatively flat route and traffic was sparse. Naturally, we had to contend with a few strange dogs that seemed awfully angry at the audacity we exhibited in crossing their turf, but by that point in our lives we had learned a thing or two about evading mad dogs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our route took us past the path to the railroad, but other than a casual remark about the Amtrak experience we ignored it. Instead, we kept following the road as it snaked through the countryside, gradually growing more and more narrow, or so it seemed. At the halfway point, there was a railroad crossing leading to Highway 11, which siphoned off most of the Leeville traffic. We stayed on the rarely traveled segment of Leeville Road, with the railroad tracks drawing a hard boundary between it and Highway 11. The road was not nearly as direct as the highway, but it did follow the same general trajectory of the rails, albeit a meandering path that honored old property lines. There were only a few homes that far out, which ranged from trailers and small shotgun houses with abandoned cars adorning the front yard to a beautiful estate with an immaculate home and a picturesque field stocked with horses that trotted beside the fence sometimes as we rode by. As the temperatures increased, the inefficiency of the route became more obvious, but we liked having it to ourselves for the most part.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only trouble we had on that segment of the trip happened one afternoon on our way back home. We were shooting the bull, carelessly zig-zagging in the right hand lane, when a little car with about four teenagers came speeding up from behind us. The noisy engine and their shouts grabbed our attention as they came even with us. In the instant I looked over my shoulder, I saw a coke bottle hurtling end over end through the air in our general direction. It narrowly missed Todd's head, thanks to a quick duck on his part, and exploded into a thousand sharp fragments on the pavement between our bikes. The car darted past us as the passengers laughed their heads off, infuriating us. So, we started yelling at them and shaking our fists&mdash;probably not the best reaction for a couple of twelve-year-old kids in the middle of nowhere. And when the brake lights lit up and the car abruptly slowed to a roll, we knew our gestures had not gone unnoticed, much to our disappointment. We were about to make a 180 degree turn and flee when the car tires squealed weakly and they disappeared down the road, more intense laughter clearly discernible. We were glad to make it home without another incident, but the whole way back we kept a close eye on our blind spot and prayed the car would not return for another round. We never told anyone about it; since no one was hurt there was no point jeopardizing future trips to the store.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our destination was a small mom and pop store with two pumps and a worn-out screen door at the entrance. We traveled there with our pockets full of coins, which we exchanged for Nehi peach sodas, Barq's root beer, ice cream sandwiches, sunflower seeds, and other forms of junk food. We sat on the sidewalk in front of the store savoring our sugary snacks, speaking to the kind customers who acknowledged our presence. We watched people pump gas and observed the cars speeding by on the highway as we chatted with one another about whatever happened to be on our minds. Todd and I could deliberate for hours on any random topic. And although we did not always agree on everything, our gift of gab was one of the main reasons our friendship was so strong. When we finished, we would toss our trash in the banged-up metal garbage can next to the ice chest and make our way back home&mdash;except for one afternoon when we took a brief detour.
      </p>
      <p>
        At some point during our conversation that day, we started talking about an old decrepit cemetery not far down the road running alongside the station. I described a story I saw on the local TV station about alleged grave robbers in the Eastabuchie area. We imagined they were after civil war relics buried with the remains of soldiers, and since it was the only cemetery that we were aware of in Eastabuchie, or PIB for that matter, we realized we were sitting on a golden opportunity to check out the scene of the crime. The news story was real, but the gory details were products of our rather active imaginations. That afternoon, however, no one could have convinced us otherwise, and we scarfed down the rest of our Moon Pies to get on with our investigation. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We arrived at the cemetery in no time; it was just a short ride around the corner. Neglected for several years, the cemetery was filled with scraggly brush and massive live oaks. The low, sprawling limbs of the oaks looked like monster arms with knots that resembled elbows and branches that tapered to crooked silhouettes like long, bony fingers. Hanging down from the branches were thick masses of gray moss, which nearly touched the brush and weeds below. Even in broad daylight, there was a veil of darkness over the graveyard from the shadows of these ancient trees. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As we pushed open the rusty iron gate with its ornamental spikes, it emitted an eerie groan that was far more ominous than the squealing carport door at Todd's house, to which we always played air guitar upon exiting. But that afternoon, no such frivolous urges struck us as we crept into the sinister necropolis. We were mindful of each step, mostly worried about stepping in a hole, but also scanning surfaces for snakes since the whole site was surrounded by swampland. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The sounds of traffic on the highway faded as we eased further into the structure formed by the canopy of branches. When a crow on a nearby limb suddenly cawed, we nearly jumped out of our skin, but it gave us enough of a  warning to duck as it took flight, sweeping low over our heads. A light breeze stirring from somewhere deeper inside the abyss felt cool against my skin and brought the damp, moldy smell of decay to my nostrils. The fingers of the trees and their shadows twitched spastically under the influence of the wind, like they were grasping for something. These ominous shadows also danced on the weathered headstones, which were leaning in all sorts of unnatural angles. Every now and then, a couple of branches would pop against one another, which sounded just like an axe set to a trunk. With each step, my heart thumped faster and louder in my ears, leaving me a bit light-headed as the last inklings of courage between us grew dim.
      </p>
      <p>
        Speaking to one another reinforced the fortitude between us enough to maintain forward progress. But we did not do ourselves any favors when we began hypothesizing about the sinister scenario unfolding all around us. We ran through a few theories, but the one that really got us blamed everything on our trespass, which had certainly upset the ghosts of the robbed soldiers. It was so many years ago, I am not sure who came voiced it, but we jumped to the conclusion that these ghosts had mistaken us for the robbers, and they were closing in to have their revenge. Cleary, we were experiencing the effects of a few too many glances at horror movie scenes. 
      </p>
      <p>
        At that instant, whatever we had hoped to achieve in the old cemetery took flight like the old crow, and we scrambled toward the gate like a couple of scared dogs, tails between our legs. It must have been some sight, seeing us stumbling over sticks and bumping into one another like a couple of stooges. And after dashing through the gate without stopping to close it, we grabbed our bikes from where we left them laying by the road. Mounting our trusty steeds, we pedaled with a newfound gusto, never looking back, and clocked our fastest return trip of the summer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sleep came with some difficulty for a few nights as we each reflected on the spirits that we had undoubtably disturbed; we could only hope that somehow they were confined to the grounds of the cemetery. Eventually the fear subsided, as it always did, and we were able to make a few more trips to the gas station. Yet, we never felt the urge to return to the Eastabuchie cemetery, or even glance through the trees in that general direction.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Many memories were made on our bike rides, but only one involved the straight stretch of Highway 11, which began at the Eastabuchie gas station and continued to the junkyard at Petal's edge. It happened on an August afternoon, hotter and more humid than normal with a heat index well over 100 degrees. The first leg of our trip really sapped the bulk of our energy, and the snacks at the store failed to completely restore us. We spent more time than normal resting in the shade of the sidewalk, dreading the ride home and passively gazing at vehicles as they sped by. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not sure whose brilliant idea it was, but we started considering an alternate route home down Highway 11. The country road with all its curves seemed so inefficient, but with the highway's true trajectory we figured we could save a half hour following it to the next railroad crossing a mile or so up the road. It seemed like such a perfectly logical plan at the time that we wondered why we had not thought of it sooner. Maybe it was the heat merging with our intense desire to return to the cool air-conditioning of our homes that led us astray as we plopped down on our bikes and followed through with our plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the first quarter mile we enjoyed a generous dirt shoulder, and it seemed like a good decision. But when the shoulder all but vanished just beyond the dingy county bar in a cinder block building known as Peggy's Lounge, so did any illusions of safety or arriving home quickly. At that point, we had to decide if we would ride in the tall grass of the shoulder or take our chances on the edge of the highway. The shoulder proved too rough to navigate, so we took our chances on the edge of the road. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The first car that zoomed past us really laid on the horn, paying homage to the stupidity of our plight; there was only so much room for cars to swerve to avoid hitting us with the oncoming traffic. We decided to jump off the road onto the shoulder to avoid the sporadic streams of vehicles. It really felt like we were living out a game of Frogger as we alternated between pedaling a few feet, just enough to start moving really, and diving into the tall grass, which was more like falling actually since the drop off from the asphalt was a bit steep. And when one of those 18-wheelers blew by the wind from it nearly knocked us down into the ditch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our progress was demoralizingly slow, and the horns continued to remind us the embarrassment of our predicament. But we had gone too far to turn back; we would face the traffic either way. Soon we ditched the idea of riding altogether and begrudgingly walked our bikes along the shoulder for the remaining mile and a half until we finally reached the crossing. There, we dashed across the highway and crossed the tracks to the relative safety of Leeville Road, where we wobbled back home cursing the evil essence of Highway 11. At the time, we could not have known that the highway would strike again years later after Todd got a new sports car, but that was another story altogether. Anyway, we limped home, and along the way lost any desire to return to the gas station. With all the ghosts, highway traffic, and bottle attacks, we had enough of Eastabuchie for a while.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        They tore down the old Eastabuchie gas station a couple of decades ago to make way for a larger station complete with a restaurant where you can get a greasy burger and fries cheap. On trips back home, I have gone out of my way a few times to top off my gas tank at the new store. Just being in the area caused memories to flow like the waters of the creeks and rivers we waded as boys. Staring at the sidewalk, I could almost hear our laughter as I envisioned us enjoying our snacks with a frosty glass bottle of root beer, which were free at home but somehow tasted better at the store. The roar of a train horn across the highway triggered the memories of us sacrificing pennies on the rail and celebrating wildly when an Amtrak engineer acknowledged our presence. I glanced around the corner in the direction of the old cemetery, since cleaned up, and pictured us racing by on our bikes, standing up as we pedaled to gain extra speed like we did in the Gullies. And, of course, there was the shoulder of Highway 11, still just as narrow as the day we tried what seemed like a short cut home. I suppose if I saw a pedestrian walking down that stretch today, I would still think it a foolish act, unless it was a couple of boys. In that case, I would just assume they were learning a hard lesson on perspective, even as the latch clicked free and the gate swung open to their next adventure.
