        When we were boys the adults were always warning my friend Todd and me to never trust strange dogs. This advice probably saved us a few extra trips to the doctor because dogs were everywhere in the rural community of Leeville where we were raised. Most families owned at least one dog and nearly all of them lived untethered outside. Some were pure bred and the rest were mutts, with the latter being better natured, generally speaking. And even though the barbed wire fences between properties could not have prevented them from straying, it was uncommon to see them away from their respective homes. Odd as it may seem, the abundance of dogs in Leeville didn't distinguish it from other rural places in Mississippi; similar situations existed beyond the city limit signs everywhere. You might assume that for a couple of boys who shared an affinity for dogs, a childhood in Leeville was paradise. And I suppose, in many ways, that assumption would be correct. But the truth is growing up around all those country dogs was complicated. No matter how you felt about them, they certainly made life interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both my family and Todd's did their part to sustain the dog population. I can't recall a time when we didn't each have a canine companion. And wherever we went, they were usually running circles around us, always desperate for more attention. Todd and I generally liked all dogs, at least initially. But for some of our four-legged neighbors, the feeling was anything but mutual. Nothing infuriated these animals more than a couple of boys speeding down the road on bikes, penetrating the invisible domains that they so passionately defended. They never failed to chase us, ending their pursuit only when we were well outside their range. These pets really ruined the local market for home security systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a few terrifying encounters, we knew exactly where our nemeses lived along the routes where we rode our bikes. When we approached their homes, we pedaled as fast possible in anticipation of their ambush. As long as we were zooming past on our bikes, the chance of them catching us was slim. But some of them moved like lightning, and there were days when we felt their warm breath and slobber on our skin as their jaws snapped within inches of our calves. Such experiences were hard to forget, and we shuttered to think what might happen if they caught us on foot. One day, we almost found out.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a late autumn day, and everyone welcomed the chilly breeze that had swept in that afternoon, even though it called for a sleeve. The conditions were perfect for us to take to the woods. On any other day, we might have rounded up our dogs and retraced our usual paths through the valley. But we found ourselves hungry for something a bit more adventurous that day, perhaps in response to the return of cooler temperatures. Anyway, we decided to slip into the woods just beyond the power line, behind the land our families owned. It was uncharted territory for us, but we knew it held hundreds of acres of mature timberland. We had been working up the courage to explore that land for years. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It wasn't safe to bring our dogs on long bike rides or treks into unknown sections of the woods because if we encountered another dog, we would almost certainly have a fight on our hands. And unless you had a water hose, breaking up a dog fight was asking for trouble. So, as much as it hurt, we snuck away from our homes, unbeknownst to our faithful friends, and rendezvoused down the hill behind my house where a creek with no name wound its way through the valley.
      </p>
      <p>
        I guess it was about a year or two before that particular day when we met at the same spot after a freak snowstorm during spring break. Our objective then was simple; gain access to the open field under the power line, which was covered with inches of powdery snow, and engage in our first snowball fight. The swollen creek with its iced over edges was all that stood between us and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Since there was no bridge over the creek, we would have to jump it in order to follow through with our plans.
      </p>
      <p>
        To understand what happened next, I should fill you in on one the most obvious differences between Todd and me in those early years. I wouldn't say Todd was overweight, but he was husky compared to me (I was as skinny as a bean pole) and a couple of inches shorter. The difference in our physiques simply meant that, under normal circumstances, I could run faster and jump slightly farther. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My initial jump over the icy creek lacked grace, but it was successful. I landed on the other side with a few inches to spare. Meanwhile, Todd had acquired cold feet. I responded with a strong push to convince him he could make it across. It took a while, but he eventually agreed to try. After a generous running start, he planted his feet and sprung into the air. I noticed that he jumped too early, and the dreadful look on his face as he began to descend revealed that he knew it too. I cringed as I witnessed my friend crashing through the thin layer of ice about a foot from the edge. It wasn't terribly deep, but he ended up soaking wet from the waist down. Neither of us knew the specifics of hypothermia, but we ran home to avoid it anyway. The whole way back, Todd cussed me through chattering teeth. After he changed clothes and we warmed up by the fireplace, he began to appreciate the humor in his ill-fated jump. We enjoyed a good laugh about it as we returned to the creek to find a better place to cross. It was too cold to stay out long, yet we managed to have a quick snowball fight. It was the only one we had together.
      </p>
      <p>
        We remembered the snowball fight and Todd's dip in the creek when we met down the hill that afternoon. Thanks to a dry autumn, the creek was running low that day. In fact, it was so low that we crossed it with nothing more than a long stride. We traversed the field and soon reached the back property line, delineated by a barbed wire fence. Such fences were almost as common as dogs in Leeville, and this one no different than the others; slightly less than four feet tall with three strands of barbed wire strung between ragged fence posts. Long before our time, these fences were taunt and effective at keeping livestock in their pastures. But those days were long gone, and the sagging fences did little to restrict our movement. Nevertheless, crossing these obstacles was a delicate process and we had learned the hard way to take our time. The main objective in slipping through a barbed wire fence was to avoid the multitude of rusty barbs with their razor sharp edges. Raise up too soon and the barbs would rip clothes and flesh without discrimination. Since we were together, we used teamwork to accomplish this feat. One pulled up on the middle wire, while the one crossing pushed the bottom strand down and slipped between the gap. When we were both safely on the other side, we got our bearings and commenced our expedition.
      </p>
      <p>
        We walked southerly, climbing a ridge to an elevation that gave us a commanding view of the power line and the barbed wire fence, both of which ran parallel to the ridge. We used these features as reference points to guide our route. We continued hiking in this manner until we spotted an open field adjoining the power line. The grassy field stretched up a long, gradually sloping hill. At the top, we could see the back side of a house. Because we were approaching it from the rear, it wasn't completely obvious whose house we were behind. We didn't dwell this uncertainty, however, because we had our eyes on a small cow pond at the base of the hill. I don't know if it was the idea of skipping rocks, the chance to see fish, or simply the allure of something new, but that pond called us, and we were powerless to resist. So, without any concern for the blatant act of trespass that we were about to commit, we carefully crossed back through the barbed wire, exiting the cover of the woods. We jogged over to the pond, reaching it in short order because it wasn't terribly far away. Anyone could have seen us from the hilltop; we were totally exposed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Todd was the first to notice the flash of white at the house. At the time, I had my head down searching for rocks. Later, he would tell me the object emerged from the shadows cast upon the back porch by a cluster of tall pines nearby. Back and forth it darted, sweeping the perimeter. "What the heck is that?" Todd asked. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When I lookup up and followed the point of Todd's index finger, I too saw the fuzzy object, squinting because it was a considerable distance away. It seemed so white that it reflected the sun as it began to descend the hill in our general direction. It moved slowly at first, and then rapidly accelerated thanks to the downward slope. It really was a surreal sight, like watching a jet approaching head-on in utter silence as it outran the sound of its engines. For a moment we were frozen there, even as the answer to Todd's question was gradually forming in our minds. And when the intense barking and growling finally reached our ears, we remembered the perpetually piqued pit bulldog that lived down the road. They called him Butch, and I honestly couldn't imagine a more fitting name. Of all the strange dogs we knew, he was the most terrifying. In fact, Butch was the sole reason we never road our bikes toward town. How we forgot him that day, I'm not sure.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Oh man! That's Butch! Run!" I said, forgetting all about the cow pond. We may not have set an Olympic record in our mad dash for the woods, but we definitely improved our personal best record for the 40-yard dash. When we reached the woods, our pace was slowed by tree dodging and gopher hole jumping. Still, we managed to keep moving at a decent velocity. I was a few feet ahead of Todd, and I saw the barbed wire fence up ahead; the same one we had painstakingly crossed earlier. I knew we couldn't afford to waste much time crossing it this time. Butch was surely gaining ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I reached the fence, I dove headfirst under the bottom strand of wire taking advantage of a slight depression in the ground. I'm not sure how I managed to avoid laying open the skin on my back, but I made it without a scratch. I jumped up quickly and prepared to pull the strands apart so Todd could squeeze through. When I turned back, I was confronted by the sight of my friend leaping over the fence like a gazelle! Carl Lewis had nothing on Todd that day as he soared over the top strand with his legs stretched out and his hands held straight up in the air. For a split second, I forgot all about ole Butch. In mid-air Todd let out one of his patented hollers, and I felt compelled to applause. But I didn't, because after he stuck the landing and started scurrying up the ridge, never breaking stride, I realized that I was now between Todd and the demonic dog. I benefited from an extra jolt of adrenaline and quickly resumed my retreat, following Todd's lead along the ridge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Todd continued to lead for a while as we zigzagged to avoid various obstacles. By the time we reached the fence where our adventure began, Butch's barking had ceased. Relatively confident we were safe, we carefully crossed the fence and then ran up the hill into my back yard, giving my golden retriever quite a surprise. When we finally reached my back porch, we held our hands over our heads to catch our breath. As soon as our breathing returned to normal, we began recounting the slide and jump (but mostly Todd's jump), reenacting it in the back yard. We laughed so hard it hurt. By the skin of our teeth, we escaped disaster that afternoon. If Butch hadn't been up in years, he might have caught us. Honestly, we couldn't blame him; we were trespassing, and he was defending his home. Naturally, we never bothered Butch again. Like I said, those country dogs made life interesting.
