        The Petal Journal was a small newspaper published every Thursday to appease the curiosity of our small South Mississippi town. Its arrival usually had little impact on Todd and me, except for day the article about us appeared therein. We wasted no time driving home from school that afternoon, and upon reaching his house we made a beeline for the Journal copy folded over the arm of his dad's recliner. We found the article on page two under the title "Young artists ink animated laughs". Beside the article was a staged black and white photo of us taken the week before. As we read it, sheepish grins gave way to fits of laughter. We scanned it again, taking turns reading excerpts out loud as we tried to comprehend our sudden fame.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Did we really say that?" I asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I don't know, but it sounds pretty good. I'll take it." Todd replied with his usual snicker that seemed to rise from his very soul. It was hard to fathom how our half-baked idea had become the subject of a newspaper article, but the sight of it gave us a profound sense of accomplishment.
      </p>
      <p>
        I said, "Let's go get my sketch book. We never finished the one with the fishing worm. It only needs a good caption." Todd tucked the Journal under his arm, and we trotted out the door pondering ideas along the way. We couldn't believe our luck.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pure luck was the only way we could explain the genesis of the article. The wheels were set in motion in the dugout during a high school baseball game our junior year. I played on the team, mostly pinch running for pitchers or substituting in for starters when we enjoyed a big lead. Todd wasn't on the team, but he was probably in the stands cutting up with friends that night. I stood up to stretch my legs between innings and walked to the side of the dugout near home plate where the Journal's sports reporter sat each game. She was practically part of the team, chatting with us as she scribbled notes. As I approached her end of the dugout, someone mentioned my habit of drawing cartoons during bus rides to away games. Naturally, the reporter picked up on it and said, "You should show me your cartoons sometime, Chad. Maybe we could print them in the Journal."
      </p>
      <p>
        It sounded good to me; I certainly wasn't destined to appear in the Journal for baseball heroics any time soon. Yet I knew it would take a lot more than a silly sketch of Coach Joe to make a good cartoon. In an attempt to lower her expectations, I replied, "I don't really have any good cartoons to show yet. I just sketch funny faces on the bus to kill time."
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, I remembered the cartooning venture Todd and I had discussed recently and added, "My friend, Todd, and I thought about teaming up to make cartoons. He's a pretty good writer so we decided he could handle the captions and I could do the drawing. We have some ideas, but we haven't finished anything yet."
      </p>
      <p>
        She said, "Well, you should keep trying. It sounds like a neat idea. In fact, if you don't mind me sharing it with another reporter, he may want to write an article about you two."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Uh, sure," I replied. And with the crack of a bat, our attention returned to the game. I walked back to the middle of the dugout and sat with my teammates, assuming that would be the end of it. I thought to myself, "Why would anyone want to write an article about us?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Much to our surprise, the other reporter (possibly the only other Journal reporter) called the high school to arrange an interview with us later that week. On the day of the interview, Todd and I dressed up. I wore my favorite shirt tucked in, and Todd went all out donning a dress shirt and tie. We met with the reporter in the guidance counselor's tiny office during the last half of our AP History class. Mr. Hinton didn't seem to mind our departure; we gave him fits. As we walked down the empty hall and caught glimpses of our friends still in class, we felt like big shots. But my anxiety grew as we closed the distance to the office. Todd, however, seemed genuinely excited.
      </p>

        The reporter was direct, far less friendly than the sportswriter. I guessed that he would have preferred an investigation into some juicy controversy, but Petal was fresh out of those. We fielded his questions, improvising along the way as he probed us about our inspiration and specific plans that we hadn't completely worked out. I brought my sketch book with a couple of draft cartoons to show him, but neither was ready for print. The reporter kindly agreed it would be premature to print our cartoons as he pocketed his tape recorder. He asked us to act like we were collaborating on a piece and snapped a photo with the 35mm camera that hung from his neck. He said he would write up the article and try to get into next week's paper. We each shook his hand and walked out to our lockers as the bell between classes sounded. We weren't sure how the interview went and wondered how this thing blew up so fast. I think we both expected he would decide not to write the story. But it appeared the next Thursday, as promised. And, after we read it, we were thankful that the reporter used his artistic license; his interpretation read much clearer than the actual statements that spilled from our mouths. It was a surreal moment, ever so brief, and proof that not much happened in our sleepy town.

        The cartooning idea stemmed from our obsession with The Far Side, a single frame cartoon by Gary Larson. The Far Side series seemed to mirror the odd sense of humor that we shared, or perhaps it shaped how we looked at the world around us. Mr. Larson mixed ordinary things, like cows, chickens, dogs, and cats, with common situations to produce hilarious results. He did it using simple drawings and an economy of well-placed lines. The best of his cartoons never grew old, and we often reflected on his latest work.
      </p>
      <p>
        We enjoyed all the Far Side cartoons, but our favorite was taped to the front of our AP English teacher's podium. It was a masterpiece that depicted a cowboy sitting on a horse atop a hill gazing out over a vast prairie. With a rifle wedged in his saddle, it was clear that the cowboy and his horse were hunting game. A single tree stood beside the cowboy with a few limbs and nary a leaf. One limb hung over the cowboy and on it sat a Buffalo with his back hooves dangling down and his front hooves grasping the limb. Like most Far Sides, the buffalo's eyes and posture succinctly revealed his concern. The cartoon had no caption, nor did it need one. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We saw that cartoon every day in class that year, and it never failed to provoke laughter. In fact, we found it hard to ignore during lectures as we sometimes struggled to keep a straight face. No matter how the day was going, the buffalo was always there hanging on and brightening our day. Perhaps that is why our teacher posted it there, facing the class on her podium. When we dreamed about making cartoons, it was examples of enduring humor like the buffalo cartoon that we hoped to give people. We soon found it was harder than it seemed.
      </p>

        Todd gave me a book one day called "The Prehistory of the Far Side". In it, Mr. Larson described how he went from an aimless record shop employee to a nationally syndicated cartoonist. His story made our dream seem possible. Todd told me I could be a cartoonist, but I said we could make cartoons together. I tried to teach him how to draw funny faces, but we soon gave up the lessons. It was as hopeless as the time he tried to teach me to play "Mary had a Little Lamb" on the piano. So, we made it a collaborative venture in which I was the illustrator and he was the writer. Our first series of cartoons focused on the perspective of a fishing worm stuck inside a bait box. It seemed clever at first, but we spent hours trying many variations with none satisfying us. After about a week of wrestling with that idea, we grew disenchanted. The problem was that we were trying to recreate The Far Side rather than invent something of our own. Even the tentative name, Over the Edge, seemed too close to Mr. Larson's creation. It didn't help that we had so many of his cartoons in our head, and we found ourselves constantly reverting back to a Far Side theme. Of course, nothing we did stacked up to Mr. Larson's cartooning excellence.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the article appeared, we enjoyed a week or two of newfound hope. But the bait worm idea never worked out and we eventually retired our dream, content to let Mr. Larson do his thing. It was better that way. We had more time to enjoy his cartoons and live out our "animated laughs" each day. Although we liked the idea of turning our passion for cartoons into an occupation, its luster quickly faded when it became work. But we never forgot the day we appeared on page two of The Petal Journal, and sometimes the memory made us wonder if a bit more persistence might have eventually launched us over the chasm between aspiration and reality.
