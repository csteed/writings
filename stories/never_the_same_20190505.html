        The only time I saw Todd's mom cry happened on the eve of our high school graduation. Todd and I were in his living room discussing post-ceremony celebration options when she interrupted us by wrapping her arms around our necks. As she pulled us together in a collective embrace, I caught a glimpse of her tear-stained cheek. Between sniffles, she uttered an affirmation of the unique friendship that we had shared. A dirt path carved into the shoulder of the sinuous county road that connected our homes attested to the countless days we had spent together. Pulling back from us, she said, "After you boys graduate, it will never be the same." Her foreboding words were fraught with implications of storms that lay ahead. A moment later she left us, wiping away her tears on a corner of her apron as she returned to the kitchen.

        After exchanging an awkward glance, Todd and I decided to step outside for some fresh air. We attributed her emotional overflow to the anticipation of an empty nest; Todd was the youngest of her three sons and our departure for college was imminent. But the notion that our friendship would ever change seemed unimaginable. After all, we had made plans; we would live in the same town, coach our kids' baseball teams, coordinate our family vacations, and perhaps even launch a business together. The vision extended into our senior years, when we expected to spend afternoons recalling our adventures for the millionth time in rocking chairs on the front porch of some retirement home. Being both young and naive, the inevitability of change in life was beyond our grasp.

        Nevertheless, the changes began that summer as we each prepared to venture off to college in different regions of our state. The differences between now and then were subtle at first; so subtle they were overlooked. But later, when the storms swept in, there was no mistaking the prophetic nature of his mom's statement. And although we tried to avoid it, the passing of each year left us more disconnected than the last. By the end of the next decade, we were completely out of touch. Our friendship was reduced to a collection of fond memories that we related to our children, embellishing our adventures to their delight. Many years later, we wondered together why we let our friendship fade, each sharing the blame in our own way.

        Although it's been two years since Todd passed away, it's still hard for me to accept that he's gone. Most of our plans never materialized and, unfortunately, his mom's prediction was spot on. The bond we forged during our childhood, however, remains. Given the opportunity to speak with him again, I'm confident we would pick back up where we left off. Perhaps one day in heaven, where there are neither storms nor tears, we will enjoy such a reunion.
