        In the pasture beside Todd's house, a weathered shed stood in the shadows of some tall pines near the road. For years Todd and I had ignored it, but one December afternoon during our sophomore year of high school we pried open the door and crossed the threshold into our first business venture, a fireworks stand. It wasn't an original idea; Todd's two older brothers had used the shed to sell fireworks many years before us. In fact, we found a display shelf they had built for their endeavor in the forgotten miscellany stored inside. It was dirty but sturdy enough to use again, which we interpreted a sign that we should move forward with the first step; asking our parents for permission. They approved of our plan and we spent the next Saturday clearing out space near the large front window. Todd's older brother, Mark, helped us run electricity to the shed using a long extension cord plugged into a carport outlet. He also connected us with a wholesaler who let us stock our stand on the agreement that we only paid for what we sold. From that point on, we were on our own.

        Like most other kids in the country, we had years of experience shooting fireworks around New Year's Eve and on the Fourth of July. We drew from this hands-on knowledge to stock our stand with a variety of products, from standard bottle rockets and Roman candles to a formidable slab of explosives called "The Battle of North and South", which was our largest and most expensive item. When we finished arranging items on the shelf, we stared at the cartoonish war scene adorning "The Battle" as we placed it in the center of our display and vowed to shoot it ourselves if it remained on New Year's Eve.

        We envisioned customers jamming the road, depleting our stock, and filling our money box when we opened the next weekend. But only one, maybe two, customers stopped by. We postulated that ineffective advertising was the problem, so we posted more signs along the road closer to town. But the new signage did little to move the needle on the velocity of our sales. Like the kitchen faucet that my dad would set to drip on nights when temperatures dipped into the teens, transactions occurred just enough to avoid freezing altogether.

        Our sales paralleled the bone-chilling weather that winter, and the frigid conditions coupled with extreme boredom made operating the stand torturous. We made two quick modifications that drastically improved the situation. First, we hauled a small TV and Nintendo game console to the shed and created a gaming lounge behind the display shelf. Huddled around the TV in two rusty folding chairs that we salvaged from a corner, we endured the long gaps between customers by playing a basketball game called "Double Dribble". To alleviate the cold, Todd found a small space heater that we placed between our chairs. If we sat close enough to it, we didn't need gloves to maintain feeling in our fingers, which made operating the game controllers much easier. Although we welcomed the wonderful warmth it provided, the heater represented a disastrous threat to the battery of nearby explosives. A stern warning from Todd's dad further increased our anxiety to the point that we found ourselves double and triple checking it when we closed each night. Our greatest fear was that the heater would somehow emit a spark that would fall on a fuse and initiate the largest and most tragic fireworks display the rural community of Leeville had ever known. It was the kind of legendary status we hoped to avoid.

        We operated the stand in tandem because it gave us more time to play video games and we found strength in numbers when dealing with customers. But about a week before Christmas Day, Todd's dad, who was a preacher, kicked off a revival and Todd's presence at the services was not up for discussion. So, I ran the stand solo each evening during that week quite content with the trickling sales.

        One especially cold night during that week, business was nonexistent. I had already decided to close early, but I wanted to finish a tight basketball game against the computer. Other than an occasional whisper of wind whirling through the circular hole in the wall behind the TV, the only sounds in the stand were muffled tones from the game and the steady hum of the heater. I was thankful for the distraction of the game as I tried to forget all the scary movie scenes that resembled my current situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Engrossed in the final minutes of the game, I never heard Mark drive up to the house. Home early from the revival, he apparently saw that I was still manning the stand and a plan emerged in his mind. After a quick trip inside, he eased up to the stand. Outside the shed near the hole behind the TV, he aimed a 12-gauge shotgun toward the sky and terminated the tranquility of the twilight with a squeeze of the trigger. The blast sounded like a howitzer as shockwaves reverberated inside the shed's cedar walls. I immediately assumed the worst; the heater had set the fireworks ablaze and soon the whole stand would explode taking me and half of Leeville with it. I dropped the game controller, knocked over my chair, and burst through the door in a mad dash for the road. Across the road there was a cow pond, and, despite the cold, I was contemplating a dive into it. But a few feet past the stand I stopped upon hearing the familiar sound of Mark's laughter. I turned around to see him doubled over with a tiny trail of smoke still drifting from the barrel. As the adrenaline effects ramped down, I heard shot from the expired shell sprinkle down from the sky in the pine straw around us. I guess he could see I was quite shaken because he helped me close down the stand. Mark nearly gave me a heart attack that evening, and even though I didn't fully appreciate it then, later I had to admit it was a great prank.

        Our sales picked up during the week before New Year's Eve, but it wasn't anything spectacular. Part of the problem stemmed from our inability to resist shooting our goods, putting us further in the hole. We justified it as good advertisement directed at the cars driving by. On several occasions, we grabbed a box of wire sparklers, taped them together in a cluster with one poked up in the center, and set it off to create a thunderous explosion far louder than anything we sold. We also invited friends over for bottle rocket wars in the open pasture behind the stand. When we had an even number of participants, we divided into teams. Otherwise, it was every boy for themselves. Fortunately, it was nearly impossible to aim bottle rockets with any degree of accuracy; most of the small missiles whizzed erratically through the air exploding well off target. But for the dozen or so that flew true, only a well-timed duck or dive prevented a trip to the ER. When our battles ended, someone's clothes had a burn hole, ears were ringing, and we all carried the poignant aroma of sweat and smoke. But by the grace of God, no one was injured. Todd and I assumed his parents didn't know about the battles, but with Todd being their third son, I suspect they knew.
      </p>

        Our last night operating the stand was New Year's Eve. As we locked up the stand, we noticed "The Battle" still perched on the shelf. Recalling our pact, we carried it to the middle of Todd's front yard and placed it a safe distance from the giant pecan tree. Around midnight, we lit the fuse and retreated to his carport where we waited for the show to begin. For about 5 minutes, "The Battle" launched volley after volley of multi-colored explosions rocking the neighborhood. It infuriated the nearby dogs, who were already on edge from the distant explosions, and they joined together in a frenzy of barking and howling. The performance ended as the paper packaging caught on fire and burned down. Exhausted, we extinguished it and parted company for the night; Todd went inside his house and I walked up the road to mine.

        After sleeping late the next day, we met around mid-morning to disassemble our stand and return the unsold fireworks to the wholesaler. We split the proceeds pocketing about a hundred dollars each, which was less than we anticipated but nevertheless a significant wad of cash for a couple of country boys. It immediately started burning in our wallets, so we went straight to the mall. We each bought a pair of overpriced designer jeans and matching baseball caps. We had just enough money left over for Ward's chili dogs and root beers, which we savored from frosted mugs. We drove home and spent the rest of the day watching football games. 
      </p>

        I think about that December every time I see fireworks stands along the road this time of year. I suppose our adventure taught us a thing or two about running a business, but we mostly just had a lot of fun. Apparently, once was enough because we never tried anything like it again.
